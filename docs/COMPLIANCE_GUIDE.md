## Understanding Compliance Scores

### Score Calculation

- Each check = 1 point
- Score = (Passed / Total) √ó 100%
- **Compliant** if score ‚â• 70% AND no critical failures

### Example Scoring

If 5 checks run:
- 5 passed = 100% 
- 4 passed = 80% 
- 3 passed = 60% 

---

## Compliance Checks

The system validates:

###  Color Compliance
- Required brand colors present?
- Forbidden colors absent?

###  Text Compliance  
- Text length within limit?
- No forbidden words?
- Readable contrast?

###  Quality Compliance
- Image quality acceptable?
- Correct aspect ratio?
- Valid file format?

---

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Generate Campaign with Compliance

```
1. Open app ‚Üí http://localhost:8501

2. Sidebar:
   - Enter API key
   - ‚òë Enable Brand Compliance
   - Upload brand_guidelines.json

3. Main area:
   - Upload campaign brief (sample_brief_en.json)
   - Upload product images (or let AI generate)

4. Click " Generate Campaign Assets"

5. View results:
   - See assets generated
   - Check compliance score
   - Expand compliance report
   - Download assets
```

-  Guidelines file is uploaded or example exists
-  Enhanced pipeline imported correctly

### No Compliance Report?

- Compliance was disabled
- Generation failed before validation
- Check logs in `logs/` directory

**Review:**
- Required colors might be missing
- Text might be too long
- Forbidden words might be present
- Check compliance report for specific issues
